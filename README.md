## Assignment Requirements

    You’ll need to use IndexedDB to add offline functionality. Review Module 18: NoSQL, Lesson 4: Add Offline Persistence with IndexedDB as a refresher on how to add this to your application.

    You should add your idb.js file to the public/js/ directory of your application.

    You’ll also need to add a service worker to your application. Review Module 19: Progressive Web Applications (PWA), Lesson 4: Using Service Workers as a refresher on how to add this to your application.

    You should add your service worker to the root of the public/ directory of your application.

    From 19.4.4:
    Service workers do NOT need webpack to work. Because the application is already using webpack, we'll only need to prepend the names of the JavaScript files to cache in the dist/ folder. Other than that, the steps to add a service worker to an application without webpack are exactly the same.

    In the module project, you used webpack to create the manifest.json file. For this application, you’ll need to create it manually and add it to the root of the public/ directory of your application. You can also review Module 19: Progressive Web Applications (PWA), Lesson 5: Convert the App to a PWA as a refresher on web manifests.

    From 19.5.3:
    A web manifest is the blueprint of a PWA. It's a JSON file that will contain the metadata such as a title, a description, and an icon that tells the user's device what it is installing and how it should look on the home screen.

    Finally, the budget tracker has a server and uses MongoDB as its database, so you’ll need to deploy this application to Heroku using MongoDB Atlas. To review this process, look at Module 18: NoSQL, Lesson 5: Add Mongoose Validation, specifically 18.5.5: Deploy to Heroku.
