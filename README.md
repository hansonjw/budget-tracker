    You should add your idb.js file to the public/js/ directory of your application.

    You’ll also need to add a service worker to your application. Review Module 19: Progressive Web Applications (PWA), Lesson 4: Using Service Workers as a refresher on how to add this to your application.

    You should add your service worker to the root of the public/ directory of your application.

    In the module project, you used webpack to create the manifest.json file.
